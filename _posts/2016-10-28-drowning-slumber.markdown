_Might it be time to reawaken?_ Is the time past to leave behind the illness and the thoughts of self destruction that gather around my head like a storm cloud, blinding the heart and soul from reflections and projections, and leaving traces of spines that hurt like thorns and cut like knives?  Sitting in a theater, gazing at the lights and shadows that form the breathtaking events of **life**, I sit comfortably numb drowning in the ponds of conformity, waiting for a sign, or perhaps a message, that will take me away from the seats of spectator, and place me with the players, those we don't see, but know they hide behind the curtains. To stay is to slumber and leave promises unresolved. And there is too much to be seen, and there is too much to be herd.
